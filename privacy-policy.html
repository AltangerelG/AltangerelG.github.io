<h2>Pizza Guy Apps - Privacy Policy for All Our Apps</h2>

<div>This policy explains specific privacy practices with respect to all or our products and services that you may use. This includes Delivery Tip Tracker (Free, Pro, and Beta), Store 7667 Maps, Store 7657 Maps, as well as any other projects. This privacy policy may change regularly.</div>

<br>

<div>Our privacy policy explains:</div>

<ul>
    <li>What information we collect and why we collect it</li>
    <li>How we use that information</li>
</ul>

<h2>Information we collect</h2>

<div>The information we collect comes in three forms: error reporting, user engagement, and local storage.</div>

<h4>Error reporting</h4>

<div>Our apps use Firebase Crashlytics, which is the industry standar method for collecting crash data and troubleshooting information.
    Firebase collects the following information:</div>

<ul>
    <li>Instance IDs</li>
    <li>Crash traces</li>
    <li>Custom error reports</li>
</ul>

<div>Firebase stores crash traces for 180 days. Additionally, it stores Instance IDs for each user indefinitely. Firebase reports indicate the device being used as well as basic
    hardware information such as RAM and Android version. Firebase internally uses your Instance ID to distinguish unique user sessions. An Instance ID is a number that is assigned to a user
    upon installing the app. We also use Firebase to provide custom error reports for non-fatal exceptions. These custom error reports contain only stack traces for the associated exceptions.
    We don't collect an advertising ID, since our apps contain no advertisements.</div>


<h4>User engagement</h4>

    <div>Our apps use Google Analytics for Firebase, which monitors user engagement. We use the default implementation for Google Analytics for Firebase, which collects the following information:</div>

<ul>
    <li>Number of users and sessions</li>
    <li>Session duration</li>
    <li>Operating systems</li>
    <li>Device models</li>
    <li>Geography</li>
    <li>First launches</li>
    <li>App opens</li>
    <li>App updates</li>
    <li>In-app purchases</li>
</ul>

    <div>Google Analytics for Firebase indefinitely stores an Instance ID for each user (the same Instance ID use by Firebase Crashlytics).
        We don't collect an advertising ID, since our apps contain no advertisements. Google Analytics for Firebase provides us with rough information about how users engage with the app (such as which
        Activities users access). It also provides anonymized information about user location. This information is approximated to the city level.
    </div>

<h4>Local storage</h4>

<div>We make extensive use of local storage to provide data persistence. Local storage comes in three forms:</div>

<ul>
    <li>SQLite database</li>
    <li>Shared Preferences</li>
    <li>User-invoked generation of CSV files and backup files</li>
</ul>

<div>All data you generate within our apps is stored in either a SQLite database or a Shared Preferences file. These are the standard methods for achieving data persistence in Android.
    These files exist locally on your device, and are inaccessible to us or the outside world. None of the data you generate within our apps is sent to an external database.
    Some of our apps allow the user to generate CSV files and backup files. These files are created locally on your device, and are inaccessible to us or the outside world. Upon generation
    of these files, you are responsible for the safety and security of the information contained within.</div>

<h2>How we use information we collect</h2>

<div>The data we collect is used solely for error reporting and troubleshooting. Our apps don't contain advertising, so our only incentive for information collection is in providing you
with a trouble-free user experience.</div>

<h2>Information we share</h2>

<div>We will only share collected information with companies, organizations, and individuals under specific circumstances:</div>

<h4>Provided Correspondence</h4>

<ul>
    <li>Information you provide to us through correspondence (including, but no limited to, email) may be shared with external organizations or individuals</li>
</ul>

<h4>App store service providers</h4>

<div>If your app is purchased through an app store we may have access to your purchase transaction information (including your email and other data that might be provided to us through the app store).
    App store services providers may provide to us or may be able to:</div>

<ul>
    <li>View statistics regarding your account, such as applications you install
    <li>Suspend or terminate access to our application or services</li>
    <li>Access or retain information stored as part of your account</li>
    <li>Receive your account information in order to satisfy applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request</li>
    <li>Restrict your ability to delete or edit information or privacy settings</li>
</ul>

<div>Please refer to your app store’s privacy policy for more information.</div>

<h4>Legal reasons</h4>

<div>We will share personal information with companies, organizations or individuals outside of our company
    if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation, or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:</div>

<ul>
    <li>Meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request</li>
    <li>Enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations</li>
    <li>Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues</li>
    <li>Protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of ourselves, our users or the public as required or permitted by law</li>
</ul>

<h2>Information security</h2>

<div>We use partners and third parties to collect, store and disseminate information.  We will not be help liable in any way for lost information from or by use of these partners,
    third party partners, or our services</div>
