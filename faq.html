<div class="faqSubHeader">for Delivery Tip Tracker</div>
<br>

<div class="faqQuestion">I'm having a problem with the app, or I would like to request a feature. What can I do?</div>
<div class="faqAnswer">You can contact me directly at gavingt@gmail.com. I'll respond as soon as possible.</div>
    
<div class="faqQuestion">Is there an iPhone version of Delivery Tip Tracker?</div>
<div class="faqAnswer">Unfortunately, no. I'm working to become a professional Android developer, so I'm purely focused on Android at the moment.</div>

<div class="faqQuestionProOnly">I got a new phone. How do I transfer my app data over from my old phone?</div>
<span class="proOnly">PRO</span>
<div class="faqAnswer">Using Google Drive makes transferring the app data easy:<br><br>

<div class="faqQuestionProOnly">My phone was broken or lost. Can I still restore my app data?</div>
<span class="proOnly">PRO</span>
<div class="faqAnswer">The app data is stored on your phone. The app reminds you periodically to back up your app data and store the database backup file on Google Drive. That way your data can always be retrieved.</br></br>Android devices are supposed to automatically back up your app data and store it to Google servers, but these automated backups can fail for a variety of reasons. It's best to make your own backup files to keep your app data safe.</div>

<div class="faqQuestion">How do I add an order?</div>
<ol class="orderedList">
	<li class="listItem">Press the <b><font color='#E03C68'>Start shift</font></b> button, and then press the <b><font color='#E03C68'>Checkmark</font></b> icon in the bottom-right to confirm the start of the shift.</li>
	<li class="listItem">From the main screen, enter any optional order info you wish (such as customer phone number, delivery address, etc...).</li>
	<li>Press <b><font color='#E03C68'>Enter tip amount</font></b>, enter an amount, and press <b><font color='#E03C68'>SUBMIT</font></b> to add the order.</li>
</ol>

<div class="faqQuestion">How do I delete an order?</div>
<div class="faqAnswer">From the main screen, simply <a href="https://youtu.be/m7eWo3JyTWk">long-press the order</a> and select <b><font color='#E03C68'>Delete order</font></b>. If the order was part of a trip containing multiple orders, the total <b><font color='#E03C68'>Dispatched orders</font></b> value for all orders on the trip will be reduced by one. 
<br><br>Alternatively, if you submitted an order by mistake, you can open the menu and select <b><font color='#E03C68'>Undo last order</font></b>. If the order was part of a trip containing multiple orders, the total <b><font color='#E03C68'>Dispatched orders</font></b> value won't be changed. Any order info you entered will be restored, allowing you to easily re-submit the order.</div>

<div class="faqQuestion">How do I edit an order after submitting it?</div>
<div class="faqAnswer">To edit the last submitted order, use the <b><font color='#E03C68'>Pencil</font></b> button at the bottom of the main screen. To edit a different order, long-press the order from the main screen and select <b><font color='#E03C68'>Edit order details</font></b>. You can also use the up/down arrows at the bottom of the <b><font color='#E03C68'>Order details</font></b> screen to quickly switch between orders.</div>

<div class="faqQuestion">How can I view additional order details from the main screen?</div>
<div class="faqAnswer"><a href="https://youtu.be/2JMIfqmIcnc">Swiping left or right on the list of orders</a> will reveal additional pages of information.</div>

<div class="faqQuestion">If I leave the store with multiple orders, how do I enter the info for all of them at once?</div>
<div class="faqAnswer"><a href="https://youtu.be/_8cdkVuAflE">Watch this video</a> or follow the steps below:</br></br>
<ol class="orderedList">
	<li class="listItem">Press the <b><font color='#E03C68'>Dispatched orders</font></b> button and select the number of orders you've left the store with.</li>
	<li class="listItem">Expand the <b><font color='#E03C68'>UPCOMING ORDERS</font></b> menu by dragging upwards from the menu near the bottom of the screen.</li>
	<li class="listItem">Enter any info you wish for these orders.</li>
	<li class="listItem">Drag downwards to collapse the <b><font color='#E03C68'>UPCOMING ORDERS</font></b> menu.</li>
	<li>As you deliver each order, enter its tip amount and the app will automatically advance to the next order.</li>
</ol></div>

<div class="faqQuestionProOnly">Does the app support split pay wage? My store pays us different rates when on the road versus in the store.</div>
<span class="proOnly">PRO</span>
<div class="faqAnswer">It does not. Accurately tracking split pay would require either 1) Constantly tracking the user's location (which would be a huge battery drain), or 2) 
Forcing the user to press a button every time they enter/leave the store. I don't like either of these options.</br></br>Instead, I recommend that you determine your average hourly pay rate and use that value as your <b><font color='#E03C68'>Hourly pay rate</font></b> in the app. You can find your average rate by looking at your paychecks and dividing your wages earned by your hours worked. In my experience, this provides a reasonable approximation of your wages earned.</div>

<div class="faqQuestion"><b><font color='#E03C68'>Voice input</font></b> isn't working for me at all. How can I fix it?</div>
<div class="faqAnswer">Conflicts with third-party digital assistants can cause <b><font color='#E03C68'>Voice input</font></b> to stop working. 
    Follow <a href="https://gavingt.github.io/enable-google-voice-typing.html">these steps</a> to fix the problem.</div>

<div class="faqQuestion">Why isn't <b><font color='#E03C68'>Voice input</font></b> recognizing a specific command?</div>
<div class="faqAnswer">The app only recognizes a very specific set of voice commands. Make sure you read the <a href="https://gavingt.github.io/voice-input-instructions.html">list of commands</a> carefully. For instance, to enter an order price you must say "price equals...", and to enter a prepaid tip amount you must say "tip amount equals...". I chose these commands because they are reliably detected by Google's Speech Recognizer (even if they're not necessarily the easiest ones to remember).</div>

<div class="faqQuestion">A customer paid for their order with a credit card, but tipped me in cash. How do I enter this into the app when using voice input?</div>
<div class="faqAnswer">Simply enter the order price, change the <b><font color='#E03C68'>Payment method</font></b> slider to cash, and then enter the tip amount. Pressing the <b><font color='#E03C68'>Payment method</font></b> slider doesn't change any of the values you've already entered.</div>

<div class="faqQuestion">How do I view info about my previous shifts in the Free version of the app?</div>
<div class="faqAnswer">You'll need the Pro version for that. The Free version only stores the current shift's data.</div>

<div class="faqQuestion">I'm tracking my odometer readings for every shift. How do I calculate my mileage based off these odometer readings?</div>
<div class="faqAnswer">There's a <a href="https://gavingt.github.io/odometer-readings-instructions.html">dedicated mileage rate option</a> for this.</div>

<div class="faqQuestion">How can I switch between different calculation types on the <b><font color='#E03C68'>Statistics</font></b> screen?</div>
<div class="faqAnswer">The options you choose in the <a href="https://youtu.be/ZZ3OM15M91s">popup window shown here</a> determine which types of stats show up on the screen.</br></br>
	<b><font color='#E03C68'>Estimated driving distance</font></b> is the app's estimate of how far you've driven, based on your store address and the delivery locations. <b><font color='#E03C68'>Odometer readings</font></b> uses your manually entered starting and ending odometer readings. Because you don't enter the ending odometer reading until the end of your shift, the corresponding stats won't have values until the shift is complete.</div>

<div class="faqQuestion">Why do I occasionally have problems with the app not finding an address, or with the address being in the wrong location?</div>
<div class="faqAnswer">The app uses Google's Geocoder service for turning the text you type or speak into full addresses, and then finding the locations of these addresses. Their Geocoder database occasionally returns incorrect results. My app does a lot of processing to try to filter out bad results, and I'm constantly improving these efforts in order to
minimize these erroneous occurences.</br></br>Correctly setting the <b><font color='#E03C68'>Address search radius</font></b> from the <b><font color='#E03C68'>Advanced settings</font></b> screen will restrict the searching of addresses only to those near your store. And if all else fails, you can define your own addresses using the <b><font color='#E03C68'>Custom address</font></b> feature.</div>

<div class="faqQuestion">What is the <b><font color='#E03C68'>Custom address</font></b> feature?</div>
<div class="faqAnswer">A custom address allows you to manually define both the location and the text of an address. This is helpful when the app can't find a particular address, or when some aspect of the address is wrong.</br></br>To create a custom address, <a href="https://youtu.be/PI6wvX03p6I">follow the steps in this video</a>.</div>

<div class="faqQuestion">Why are driving distances shown in the app sometimes inaccurate?</div>
<div class="faqAnswer">Google offers a great service for calculating driving distances. Unfortunately, they charge a ridiculous amount of money to developers for the use of this service. I would be spending far more than I earn if I enabled this service.</br></br>Instead, I use my own algorithm to estimate driving distances. The algorithm uses the starting and ending points of a given trip, and assumes you're travelling in straight lines on a grid. Of course, in the real world things aren't so straightforard. So the algorithm adds a certain percentage to the grid-based estimate to account for things like curves and backtracking. The user can customize this percentage by using the <b><font color='#E03C68'>Adjust driving distance estimate</font></b> option on the <b><font color='#E03C68'>Advanced settings</font></b> screen.</div>

<div class="faqQuestionProOnly">How can I view my <b><font color='#E03C68'>Shift history</font></b> data on my computer?</div>
<span class="proOnly">PRO</span>
<div class="faqAnswer">You can <a href="https://youtu.be/F7QRbLndZVQ">generate a spreadsheet</a> and then email it to yourself. Then, from your computer, download the file from your email client and open it in a spreadsheet program.</div>

<div class="faqQuestion">Are there any features you hope to add in the future?</div>
<div class="faqAnswer">As time permits, I hope to add the below features:
<ul>
	<li>Additional payment methods</li>
	<li><b><font color='#E03C68'>Shift notes</font></b></li>
	<li>Landscape mode</li>
	<li>Improved UI for large screens</li>
	<li><b><font color='#E03C68'>Store profiles</font></b> for conveniently switching between multiple stores with different mileage rates</li>
	<li><b><font color='#E03C68'>Shift history</font></b> filterable by day of week</li>
	<li>HERE Maps support</li>
	<li>New mileage option: mileage based on the percent of the order price</li>
	<li>Dual mileage option expanded to support an arbitrary number of mileage rates</li>
    <li>Support for overtime pay</li>
	<li>And plenty more!</li>
</ul></div>

<div class="faqQuestion">What features have you decided <b>NOT</b> to add?</div>
<div class="faqAnswer">Finding time to work on this app has become increasingly difficult. Some features would be amazing to have, but would simply require too much of my time to justify adding. In some cases, these features would also cost me money (and I don't make much from this app). So the following are features that I don't foresee ever making their way to the app:
<ul>
	<li>Using phone camera to read receipt information</li>
	<li>Support for merging database backups</li>
	<li>User customization of main screen or Statistics screen</li>
	<li>Phone number masking</li>

</ul></div>
